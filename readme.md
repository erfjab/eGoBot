Hello everyone,
I developed this project for use in my own projects to make Telegram bot development faster, simpler, and at the same time more professional.
It supports all Telegram methods and models, and also includes state management and a group handler, which were among my main needs.
I made it open source in case it might be useful to you, inspire you, or serve as a reference for study.
Ultimately, the goal is to build, maintain, and share source code.
Wish you all the best.
